    { name: "Natural Flawless", value: "Apply a 'no-makeup' makeup look. Even out the skin tone, add a hint of soft, natural-looking blush on the cheeks, apply a neutral-toned lipstick, and subtly define the eyelashes with mascara. The result should be fresh and clean." },
    { name: "Glamour Night", value: "Apply a full glamour makeup look. Create a dramatic smokey eyeshadow effect, add a sharp winged eyeliner, apply contour and highlight to define facial features, and finish with a bold, matte red lipstick." },
    { name: "Korean Dewy Look", value: "Create a 'glass skin' or 'dewy' makeup style. Apply a glowing, luminous foundation, shape the eyebrows to be straight and full, create a gradient lip effect, and keep eye makeup minimal and shimmery." },
    { name: "Bold Red Lips", value: "The main focus is the lips. Apply a classic, bold red lipstick with clean, sharp edges. Keep the rest of the makeup minimal: clean skin, defined brows, and a simple coat of mascara." },
    { name: "Smokey Eyes", value: "Create a classic smokey eye look using dark eyeshadows (black, grey, or brown), blended perfectly. Pair this with a nude or pale pink lipstick to keep the focus on the eyes." },
    { name: "Bronze Glow", value: "Give the skin a sun-kissed, bronze glow. Use warm-toned bronzer, gold or copper eyeshadow, and a glossy nude lipstick. The overall effect should be warm and radiant." },

    { name: "Natural Freshness", value: "Perform a very subtle touch-up to even out the skin tone, reduce minor redness or blotchiness, and slightly conceal any minor blemishes. The result should be unnoticeable, as if the person just has naturally great skin." },
    { name: "Reduce Shine & Oil", value: "Mattify the skin to reduce any oily appearance or shine, especially on the forehead, nose, and chin. The skin should look clean and non-greasy." },
    { name: "Brighten Eyes", value: "Subtly reduce the appearance of dark circles under the eyes and slightly brighten the whites of the eyes to make the person look more awake and refreshed." },
    { name: "Subtle Blemish Removal", value: "Identify and remove small, temporary blemishes like pimples or shaving nicks, while leaving permanent features like moles or scars untouched. The edit should be seamless." },
    { name: "Sharpen Features", value: "Apply very light and subtle contouring to slightly enhance the definition of the jawline and cheekbones. This should be extremely subtle and look completely natural." },
